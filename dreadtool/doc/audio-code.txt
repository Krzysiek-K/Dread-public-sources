						T1					delay_counter++
	<delay>				T1 T2					Hold processing until delay_counter >= <delay>						// should be at least 1 for T1/T2 packets, to make sure T1 executes before T2
	  clear_delay_bit	T2						Set:	delay_counter = 0
	  stop_bit			T1 IRQ		[option]	Stop DMA & IRQ immediately
	  end_bit			T1 IRQ		[option]	Set channel to FREE and stop all processing		(always set stop_bit with this one, as well)

	<sample>			T2 IRQ		[option]	Write address & length of sample <nnnn>, remember its playback frequency
	<volume_update>		T2 IRQ		[option]	Compute volume and write it
	<freq_update>		T2 IRQ		[option]	Compute playback frequency and write it
	<irq_block_chain>	T2			[option]	Set IRQ update block pointer, flush pending IRQs, enable IRQs
	  play_bit			T2 IRQ		[option]	Enable DMA

* Timer update packet:


	<delay>				[T1]	[option]	Delay before the packet can be processed further. Counted in [T1].
	  stop_bit			[T1]	[option]	Stop DMA & IRQ immediately
	  active_bit		[T1]	[option]	Update channel status to FREE or BUSY

	<sample>			[T2]	[option]	Write address & length of sample <nnnn>, remember its playback frequency
	<volume_update>		[T2]	[option]	Compute volume and write it
	<freq_update>		[T2]	[option]	Compute playback frequency and write it
	<irq_block_chain>	[T2]	[option]	Set IRQ update block pointer, flush pending IRQs, enable IRQs
	  play_bit			[T2]	[option]	Enable DMA



* IRQ update packet:


	  stop_bit			[irq]	[option]	Stop DMA & IRQ immediately
	  active_bit		[irq]	[option]	Update channel status to FREE or BUSY
	<sample>			[irq]	[option]	Write address & length of sample <nnnn>, remember its playback frequency
	<volume_update>		[irq]	[option]	Compute volume and write it
	<freq_update>		[irq]	[option]	Compute playback frequency and write it
	  play_bit			[irq]	[option]	Enable DMA
