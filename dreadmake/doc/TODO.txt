	PS: if I move the mouse slowly to the right with sensitivity set to 10. It doesn't register input. if I do the same thing to the left i recognizes this perfectly.
	PS: improve the first hub room readability

	0)	Ok so the config is the default basic-non expanded configuration : a1200 in quickstart mode. 3.0 kickstart (rev 39.106). Does the same with 3.1		Winuae version is 3.3.0

	1) Seems the game doesn't like AGA or 020 (at least on UAE). Screen gets glitched and completely corrupted once you start the game. It's even worse on 030.
	2) Explosions from exploding barrels isn't heard (gets extremely low volume).
	3) For some reason there's a lot of sfx getting interrupted. Feels you're making use of a single channel instead of 4.
	4) The secret door (crates) at the far right of the map  can be opened behind the wall from the outside area (the area where the red key is).
	5) Screen glitch/flashes when you complete the level.
	6) Doors opening and kept open creates some sort of a glitch sometimes with a vertical set of lines kept on screen (until the door closes up again).

	a) Lovely decoration on the previously "boring" part at the area to the right of the map.
	b) End area with the white concrete still sucks visually (sorry).
	c) Map is extremely small and generally underwhelming (in comparison the new map you showcased with the ST music example feels way more interesting)
	d) No use of the head enemy also is a bit :confused:. Makes the overal enemy variety feel lacking.
	e) Found 3 of the 4 secrets so far (machinegun).
	f) I expected the cursor keys to function in the menu (only WASD does for the moment).
	g) Sound design on the menus could use a bit extra polishing (letters dropping are too loud and the clickety sound that follows sounds distorted, also the sound when you select something doesn't feel too good).
	h) Would surely help using a loading screen (using our standard font perhaps?) as the loading at the start is quite long.
