Wuerfel_21 - Facility (v1/beta)
---
This is that long-lost "open-world" kinda map from last year. Now kinda playable thanks to new SDK (turn off OptBSP. Monster noclip still sometimes cheeses you). Use A1200 config.
Is not terrifically pretty and balancing is kinda bung (normal too hard, hard too easy?), but idk its 3AM as I post this, I may revise it at some point. Tell me what you think.
